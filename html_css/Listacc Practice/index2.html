	<h1>How to wash white cloth without using bleach</h1>
	<p>Whites are the hardest color to keep looking bright and new after just a few months' time. Your sweat and oils quickly become stains, and colors from other clothes will eventually bleed into the fabric,<br/> discoloring your bright whites into something merely whitish. But before you reach for the bleach, the ultimate chemical cleaner, try some a few of these safer, less-toxic DIY solutions out instead.</p>

	<h2>Use a Citrus Soak</h2>

	<p>Instead of sending your white laundry into the washer to get clean, whiten your yellowed items with a citrus soak. Martha Stewart recommends boiling your whites with lemons or lemon juice, turning up the heat until the water bubbles and then letting them soak for about an hour. You can also add lemon juice to your regular wash cycle and achieve similar results.</p><br/>

	<h3>Brighten with the Power of the Sun</h3>
	<p>Once your whites are freshly washed and wet, skip the dryer cycle. Instead of making them suffer through a super high heat, lay them out in the sun to naturally whiten them. According to Keeper of the Home, the sun will bleach your clothing without the smell and danger of bleach. If you've ever left something out in the sun for a long period of time, you know just how whitening its rays can be.</p>

	<h3>Add White Vinegar</h3>
	<p>Get your whites white once again by adding a dose of white vinegar during the wash cycle. White vinegar even softens fabric, bringing brightness and comfort back to your clothes.</p>
